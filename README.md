# subathon-timer

This is my personal tool that I used on my Youtube subathon (subscriber marathon) challenge. The timer automatically increases if someone subscribes, joins membership, or makes a donation, so that I don't have to do it manually.

Disclaimer: The code is simply a crap, because I just write it on rush for my personal use... and fortunately, it works!

# Tool used
- Saweria - as the donation platform (in Indonesia)
- Streamlabs - as the streaming software and connect to Youtube API
- Node.js - as the core 

# Preparation
- Install Node.js (LTS version is recomended)
- Download all of the file in this repo
- Create new folder and paste files into the folder
- Shift + right click inside the folder, then "Open PowerShell window here" 
- Install required packages using these code:
```
npm install socket.io-client@2.1
npm install saweria
npm install timer-stopwatch
npm install cluster
````

(on progess)
