# subathon-timer

This is my personal tool that I used on my Youtube subathon (subscriber marathon) challenge. The timer automatically increases if someone subscribes, joins membership, or makes a donation, so that I don't have to do it manually.

# Tool used
- Saweria - as the donation platform (in Indonesia)
- Streamlabs - as the streaming software and connect to Youtube API
- Node.js - as the core 

# How to use
- Install Node.js (LTS version is recomended)
